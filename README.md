Problems to solve:

1. Implement a recursive function called reverseStr that reverses a string.

2. Implement a recursive function that sums the digits of a number until only one digit remains.

3. Implement a recursive function that takes a number and returns the number at that point in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, fib(1) would return the first number in the sequence, fib(2) the second, etc.

You are not expected to come up with the Fibonacci formula yourself, just to implement it in JavaScript.

In this problem, the Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...

4. Implement a recursive function that totals an arbitrarily nested array of integers.

5. Implement a recursive function that determines if an array includes a particular value at any level of nesting.

6. Implement a recursive function that counts the number of objects in an arbitrarily nested object.
